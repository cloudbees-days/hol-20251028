# Lab 3. Incorporate Smart Tests into your CI workflow

In this section, you will use a toy Java project in this repository and its delivery workflow based on GitHub Action as an example, to gain better understanding of how to use Smart Tests in your CI workflow.

# Before you start
1. Your instructor has already forked a repository from `launchableinc/hands-on-lab` for you to make changes in
2. You are added as a collaborator to this fork to make edits
3. Create your own branch as `workshop-<your-name>`
4. You will create PR to merge changes into `launchableinc/hands-on-lab`

# Integrating with Launchable

In the instructor's fork, navigate to `.github/workflows/pre-merge.yml` file and click on the **Edit (pencil)** icon

## Add the Launchable CLI to workflow
Update `.github/workflows/pre-merge.yml` as follows:

```diff
        with:
          java-version: 21
          distribution: "adopt"
+     - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
+       with:
+         python-version: '3.13'
+     - name: Install Launchable command
+       run: pip install --user --upgrade launchable~=1.0
      - name: Compile
        run: mvn compile
```
<details>
<summary>Raw text for copying</summary>

```
- uses: actions/setup-python@v5
  with:
    python-version: '3.13'
- name: Install Launchable command
  run: pip install --user --upgrade launchable~=1.0
```

</details>
<br>

## Verify the Launchable CLI setup
Next, to help you make sure that you have everything set up correctly, we have the `launchable verify` command, so we'll add it to the workflow as well.

Update `.github/workflows/pre-merge.yml` as follows:
```diff
       - name: Install Launchable command
         run: pip install --user --upgrade launchable~=1.0
+      - name: Launchable verify
+        run: launchable verify
       - name: Compile
         run: mvn compile
       - name: Test
```

<details>
<summary>Raw texts for copying</summary>

```
- name: Launchable verify
  run: launchable verify
```

</details>
<br>

## Create a Pull Request to base repo
Push these changes by clicking on **Commit changes**. Create a Pull Request from your repository to the original `launchableinc/hands-on-lab` repository. Once you run GitHub Actions, you will see verification logs on GitHub Actions if the setup is successful:

```
Organization: launchable-demo
Workspace: hands-on-lab
Proxy: None
Platform: 'Linux-6.8.0-1017-azure-x86_64-with-glibc2.39'
Python version: '3.12.8'
Java command: 'java'
launchable version: '1.110.0'
Your CLI configuration is successfully verified ðŸŽ‰
```

# Recording build information
Now, let's record the build information. We've already looked at what this does in Lab 2.

## Enable full Git history

Update `.github/workflows/pre-merge.yml` as follows:
```diff
steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v5
+        with:
+          fetch-depth: 0
       - uses: actions/setup-java@v4
         with:
           java-version: 11
```

<details>
<summary>Raw text for copying</summary>

```
with:
  fetch-depth: 0
```

</details>
<br>

## Record build with Launchable CLI
Next, execute the `launchable record build` command.

Update `.github/workflows/pre-merge.yml` as follows:
```diff
run: pip install --user --upgrade launchable~=1.0
       - name: Launchable verify
         run: launchable verify
+      - name: Launchable record build
+        run: launchable record build --name ${{ github.run_id }}
       - name: Compile
         run: mvn compile
   worker-node-1:
```

<details>
<summary>Raw text for copying</summary>

```
- name: Launchable record build
  run: launchable record build --name ${{ github.run_id }}
```

</details>
<br>

Commit changes directly to your branch by clicking on **Commit changes**. If the setup is successful, you will see logs similar to the following:

```
Launchable recorded 1 commit from repository /home/runner/work/hands-on/hands-on
Launchable recorded build 3096604891 to workspace organization/workspace with commits from 1 repository:

# Running test session by predicting a subset
Now, we will start a test session. We have also looked at this in Lab 2.

## Add Launchable subset command
We will first obtain the subset of tests that should be run for this build. then pass it to the test runner, which is Maven in this case.

Notice the `--observation` flag. This is [the training wheel mode](https://www.launchableinc.com/docs/features/predictive-test-selection/observing-subset-behavior/). With this flag, Smart Test
will go through all the motions, except for actually returning all the tests. We'll use this mode
to observe the behavior/performance of the test selection, hence the name.

Update `.github/workflows/pre-merge.yml` as follows:
```diff
      - name: Compile
        run: mvn compile
+     - name: Launchable subset
+       run: |
+         launchable record session --build ${{ github.run_id }} --observation --test-suite unit-test > session.txt
+         launchable subset --session $(cat session.txt) --target 50%  maven src/test/java > launchable-subset.txt
+         cat launchable-subset.txt
      - name: Test
        run: mvn test
```
<details>
<summary>Raw text for copying</summary>

```
- name: Launchable subset
  run: |
    launchable record session --build ${{ github.run_id }} --observation --test-suite unit-test > session.txt
    launchable subset --session $(cat session.txt) --target 50% maven src/test/java > launchable-subset.txt
    cat launchable-subet.txt
```

```

Run `launchable inspect subset --subset-id XXX` to view full subset details

example.DivTest

```

## Run Maven tests with subset
Next, pass this subset to the test runner.

```diff

      - name: Test
-       run: mvn test
+       run: mvn test -Dsurefire.includesFile=launchable-subset.txt
```
<details>

```
run: mvn test -Dsurefire.includesFile=launchable-subset.txt
```

# Record test results
After tests are run, you need to report the test results to Launchable. This is done by the **launchable record tests** command.

If the test fail, GitHub Actions will stop the job and the test results will not be reported to Launchable. Therefore, you need to set `if: always()` so that test results are always reported.

## Record tests to Launchable

Update `.github/workflows/pre-merge.yml` as follows:
```diff
      - name: Test
        run: mvn test -Dsurefire.includesFile=launchable-subset.txt
+     - name: Launchable record tests
+       if: always()
+       run: launchable record tests --session $(cat session.txt) maven ./**/target/surefire-reports
```
<details>
<summary>Raw text for copying</summary>

```
- name: Launchable record tests
  if: always()
  run: launchable record tests --session $(cat session.txt) maven ./**/target/surefire-reports
```

# Check results in Launchable web-app
If everything is set up correctly, you can view the test results on Launchable as shown below: (A URL to this page is in the GitHub Actions log)

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f83dd1e6-bf9e-4091-964c-da665ffd764d" width="50%">

You should also see the report from the subset observation:

# Go live
If this was a real project, we'd keep the `--observation` flag until we accumulate enough data, then
evaluate its performance & roll out. In this workshop, we can skip this step and go live right away.

```diff
      - name: Launchable subset
        run: |
          launchable record session --build ${{ github.run_id }} > session.txt
-         launchable subset --session $(cat session.txt) --observation maven src/test/java > launchable-subset.txt
+         launchable subset --session $(cat session.txt) maven src/test/java > launchable-subset.txt
      - name: Test
        run: mvn test
```

Let's apply this change and check the result.
