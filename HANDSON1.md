# Lab 1. Environment setup

In this section, you will set up the environment for the hands-on. Specifically, you will do the following:

1. Issue an API Key
1. Install Launchable Command

Let's get started.

# Prepare the Project You Want to Integrate Smart Test

First, get the project you usually work on and want to make testing faster for.
If you havenâ€™t cloned it yet, use `git clone`. If itâ€™s already cloned, navigate to its directory.

# Prepare Your Smart Test API Token

You need an API token to use Smart Test.
Go to your workspaceâ€™s Settings > API Token and generate a new token.

**Node:** If you havenâ€™t created a workspace yet, please refer to `SIGN_UP.md` to set one up.

# Install Launchable Command

Smart Test communicates by using the launchable command-line tool.

You can install it with pip:

```
pip install --user --upgrade launchable~=1.0
```

Alternatively, you can use the provided Docker image:

```
docker pull cloudbees/launchable:v1.106.2
```

Letâ€™s check that itâ€™s installed correctly:

```
$ launchable --help

or

$ docker run --rm cloudbees/launchable:v1.106.2 --help
```


# Let's Try a Launchable Command

Now, letâ€™s test the connection using the launchable command.

```
$ LAUNCHABLE_TOKEN=<LAUNCHABLE TOKEN> launchable verify

or

$ docker run -e LAUNCHABLE_TOKEN=<LAUNCHABLE_TOKEN> --rm cloudbees/launchable:v1.106.2 verify
```

If you see a message like this, youâ€™re all set:

```
Organization: 'organization'
Workspace: 'workspace'
Proxy: None
Platform: 'Linux-6.10.14-linuxkit-aarch64-with-glibc2.36'
Python version: '3.11.13'
Java command: 'java'
launchable version: '1.106.2'
Your CLI configuration is successfully verified ðŸŽ‰
```

If you see the help message, the installation was successful.
You can now move on to the next step (HANDSON2.md).
